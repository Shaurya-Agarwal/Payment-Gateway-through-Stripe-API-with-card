# Payment-Gateway-through-Stripe-API-with-card

This is basically a simple payment gateway using Stripe API with your credit card.

If you want to implement this just simply copy the repository,
after that install all the dependencies.

Also generate your own Stripe API keys to successfully check for the completion of the payments.

Finally run your code.
